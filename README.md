Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death annually and due 
to its disease heterogeneity, it is difficult to detect during early stages. 
The tumor microenvironment (TME) includes various molecular components, such as 
immune cells, that favor tumor progression. Previous studies have utilized salivary 
cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a non-invasive means to guide early cancer detection. 
This project explores non-mutational analyses of cfDNA and considers the TME of 
GC to investigate the underlying genetic differences between healthy and cancer 
patients. We employed a low-coverage single-stranded library NGS pipeline on 
saliva samples of the two cohorts to study cfDNA characteristics including 
fragmentomics, G-quadruplex prevalence, and end-motif profiles. Our analysis 
showed a significant difference between the two cohorts for both saliva cfDNA 
characteristics and TME-specific biomarkers. These discoveries could potentially 
improve the application of cfDNA analysis in clinical settings for both early 
disease detection and monitoring its progression.
